        <h1>Privacy Policy - Conto Mio</h1>
        <p class="date">Last updated: 2026-02-16</p>

        <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
        <p>The data controller is Gregorio Visocchi Labs.<br>
        Contact: <a href="mailto:gregoriovisocchilabs@gmail.com">gregoriovisocchilabs@gmail.com</a></p>

        <h2>2. App Scope and Nature</h2>
        <p>Conto Mio is an app for creating counters, tracking counted events, and reviewing value history.
        The app does not require a user account and does not register users.</p>

        <h2>3. What Data We Process</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Data Stored Locally (on your device)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>counter data (e.g., name, current value, step, settings, and status flags),</li>
            <li>counter event history (e.g., increment/decrement/reset with timestamps),</li>
            <li>app settings (e.g., language, theme, sound, vibration, ad preferences).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data is stored locally, mainly in SQLite and system preferences (SharedPreferences).</p>

        <h3>3.2 Data Import and Export</h3>
        <p>The app allows exporting data to a JSON file and importing data from a user-selected JSON file.
        These operations are performed locally on your device and do not upload your data to our servers.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Notifications</h3>
        <p>The app can display a persistent notification for quick counting actions from the system notification area.
        On Android 13+, POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission may be required.</p>

        <h3>3.4 Advertising - Google AdMob</h3>
        <p>The app uses Google AdMob. In connection with ad delivery, Google may process, among others:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>device advertising identifier,</li>
            <li>IP address,</li>
            <li>technical device and operating system data,</li>
            <li>information about ad interactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The app includes ad preference settings (personalized / non-personalized ads).</p>
        <p>Details: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

        <h3>3.5 Android System Backups</h3>
        <p>If Android system backup is enabled on your device,
        the operating system may back up local app data (such as database and settings)
        to your account backup or during device-to-device transfer.</p>

        <h2>4. Processing Purposes and Legal Bases (GDPR)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service delivery</strong> (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR): processing local data required for app functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR): settings related to ad personalization.</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong> (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR): app maintenance through ad monetization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell user data.
        Data recipients may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Google (for AdMob advertising),</li>
            <li>operating system / backup service provider, if system backups are enabled by the user.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Transfers Outside the EEA</h2>
        <p>Google may process data outside the European Economic Area.
        Transfers are carried out in accordance with mechanisms required by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>7. Retention Period</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>local app data: until deleted by the user, overwritten by import, or app uninstallation,</li>
            <li>exported JSON files: until deleted by the user,</li>
            <li>ad-related data: according to Google policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>access your data,</li>
            <li>rectify your data,</li>
            <li>erase your data,</li>
            <li>restrict processing,</li>
            <li>data portability (for local data),</li>
            <li>object to processing,</li>
            <li>withdraw consent (where consent is the legal basis).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a competent data protection supervisory authority.</p>

        <h2>9. Security</h2>
        <p>We apply data minimization: the app works locally and does not operate our own backend for user data storage.
        We recommend securing your device (screen lock) and handling exported files carefully.</p>

        <h2>10. Children</h2>
        <p>The app is not directed to children under 13.
        If you believe a child provided data unintentionally, please contact us.</p>

        <h2>11. Policy Changes</h2>
        <p>Any changes to this policy will be published in this document with an updated date.</p>
