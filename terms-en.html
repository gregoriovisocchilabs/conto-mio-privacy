        <h2>2. Service description</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>create and manage counters,</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. License</h2>
        <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App
        solely for personal, non-commercial purposes in accordance with these terms.</p>

        <h2>4. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer the App,</li>
            <li>remove or modify copyright notices and proprietary markings,</li>

            <li>distribute, sublicense, or rent the App without developer consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Intellectual property</h2>
        <p>All intellectual property rights in the App, including code, name, graphics, interface layout,
        and materials, belong to Gregorio Visocchi Labs. Use of the App does not transfer ownership rights to you.</p>

        <h2>6. User data</h2>
        <p>User data is generally stored locally on the device.
        For details about data processing, ads, and backups, see the
        <a href="privacy-en.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

        <h2>7. App purpose</h2>
        <p>The App is a supportive productivity tool. It is not advisory software and must not be treated as
        a system for critical decisions (e.g., medical, legal, financial, or safety-related).
        You are responsible for how you use App results and data.</p>

        <h2>8. Advertising</h2>
        <p>The App may display ads via Google AdMob.
        Ads help keep the App free of charge.
        You can choose ad personalization preferences in the App settings.</p>

        <h2>9. Availability and updates</h2>
        <p>We make reasonable efforts to keep the App working properly, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted availability.
        We may introduce updates, fixes, feature changes, or temporary limitations of selected functionality.</p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The App is provided “AS IS”, without express or implied warranties,
        to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Gregorio Visocchi Labs is not liable for indirect,
        incidental, consequential damages, loss of profits, or loss of data resulting from use
        or inability to use the App.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to the terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms. Changes are communicated by publishing a new version with an updated date.
        Continued use of the App after publication means acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

        <h2>13. Termination of use</h2>
        <p>You may stop using the App at any time, including by uninstalling it.
        We may restrict or terminate access to the App in case of breach of these terms
        or applicable law.</p>

        <h2>14. Governing law and contact</h2>
